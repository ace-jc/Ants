Pheromone Simulation 

This experiment is one of ants using pheromones to communicate in finding food. It simulates this by creating a world in which adjacent containers in a matrix allow the ant objects to communicate. Each ant is responsible for locating the pheromone which takes them either to the hive or to the food. Reinforcement parameters and pheromone trail length are currently user defined. 

Currently, well tuned pheromone parameters, trail length and ant population generates food deliveries on the order of five times above random motion. 

Project is currently using some windows system calls in order to display dynamic updates. However, minor tweaks to the code will allow code to run on linux.
